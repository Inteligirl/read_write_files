# read_write_files
C# application learning to read and write files

## Project Description:
This was not assigned as class work. I decided to make one application that would cover several topics mentioned in my school text book.

## My thought process

The particular concepts used in this application were not covered by my class. I decided it would be worth just working through to see what these objects and methods do. This application just does basic file creation, open and save using dialogs. I left message boxes in to determine if the event was triggered on click. I can tell there is alot more to code into this. The save dialog isn't performing any function other than to open. There is no file type listed in the save dialog. I will have to learn more on how to manipulate those later down the road.
